# ITCS-6190 Assignment 3: AWS Data Processing Pipeline

This project demonstrates an end-to-end serverless data processing pipeline on AWS. The process involves ingesting raw data into S3, using a Lambda function to process it, cataloging the data with AWS Glue, and finally, querying and visualizing the results on a dynamic webpage hosted on an EC2 instance.

## 1. Amazon S3 Bucket Structure 🪣

First, set up an S3 bucket with the following folder structure to manage the data workflow:

* **`bucket-name/`**
    * **`raw/`**: For incoming raw data files.
    * **`processed/`**: For cleaned and filtered data output by the Lambda function.
    * **`enriched/`**: For storing athena query results.
 

### Explanation
The S3 Bucket stores the CSV files to manage the data workflow. The bucket will contain the raw CSV file containing the orders, and when a query is executed, those CSV files will be stored in the bucket.

### Approach
My approach to creating the bucket was to follow the same approach I used in the Hands-On activities. I kept all the default options except I changed the Bucket namespace to Account Regional namespace.

## 2. IAM Roles and Permissions 🔐

Create the following IAM roles to grant AWS services the necessary permissions to interact with each other securely.

### Lambda Execution Role

1.  Navigate to **IAM** -> **Roles** and click **Create role**.
2.  **Trusted entity type**: Select **AWS service**.
3.  **Use case**: Select **Lambda**.
4.  **Add Permissions**: Attach the following managed policies:
    * `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`
    * `AmazonS3FullAccess`
5.  Give the role a descriptive name (e.g., `Lambda-S3-Processing-Role`) and create it.

#### Explanation 
The Lambda Execution Role allows a user to run code without managing a server. It is a serverless architecture, and you pay only for the compute time you consume.

#### Approach
My approach to creating the Lambda was following the instructions above. I created the role by selecting AWS servce as the entity type, lambda as the use case, and the giving it the two permissions that are listed above.

### Glue Service Role

1.  Create another IAM role for **AWS service** with the use case **Glue**.
2.  **Add Permissions**: Attach the following policies:
    * `AmazonS3FullAccess`
    * `AWSGlueConsoleFullAccess`
    * `AWSGlueServiceRole`
3.  Name the role (e.g., `Glue-S3-Crawler-Role`) and create it.

#### Explanation
The Glue Service Role allows a user to use Glue which makes it easy to load and use data for analytics.

#### Approach 
My approach to creating the Glue Service Role was following the instructions above.

### EC2 Instance Profile

1.  Create a final IAM role for **AWS service** with the use case **EC2**.
2.  **Add Permissions**: Attach the following policies:
    * `AmazonS3FullAccess`
    * `AmazonAthenaFullAccess`
3.  Name the role (e.g., `EC2-Athena-Dashboard-Role`) and create it.

#### Explanation
Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure compute capacity in the cloud. EC2 is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.

#### Approach 
My approach to creating the EC2 instance was following the instructions above.

## 3. Create the Lambda Function ⚙️

This function will automatically process files uploaded to the `raw/` S3 folder.

1.  Navigate to the **Lambda** service in the AWS Console.
2.  Click **Create function**.
3.  Select **Author from scratch**.
4.  **Function name**: `FilterAndProcessOrders`
5.  **Runtime**: Select **Python 3.9** (or a newer version).
6.  **Permissions**: Expand *Change default execution role*, select **Use an existing role**, and choose the **Lambda Execution Role** you created.
7.  Click **Create function**.
8.  In the **Code source** editor, replace the default code with LambdaFunction.py code for processing the raw data.

### Explanation
The Lambda Function will process the orders.csv file that will eventually be uploaded to the S3 bucket that was created earlier.

### Approach
My approach to creating the Lambda Function was by following the instructions above and pasting the code from `LambdaFunction.py` to the Code Source editor.

### Screenshot

## 4. Configure the S3 Trigger ⚡

Set up the S3 trigger to invoke your Lambda function automatically.

1.  In the Lambda function overview, click **+ Add trigger**.
2.  **Source**: Choose **S3**.
3.  **Bucket**: Select your S3 bucket.
4.  **Event types**: Choose **All object create events**.
5.  **Prefix (Required)**: Enter `raw/`. This ensures the function only triggers for files in this folder.
6.  **Suffix (Recommended)**: Enter `.csv`.
7.  Check the acknowledgment box and click **Add**.

--- 
**Start Processing of Raw Data**: Now upload the Orders.csv file into the `raw/` folder of the S3 Bucket. This will automatically trigger the Lambda function.
---

### Explanation 
The Trigger will automatically execute the Lambda Function when it detects a CSV file in the raw directory.

### Approach
My approach to creating the Trigger was to follow the instructins above and ensure the prefix and suffix are correct before adding it.
